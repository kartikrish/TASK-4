📌 Project Description

This is a simple modular calculator application written in Java.
The program demonstrates basic Java concepts such as methods, method overloading, exception handling, and pass-by-value behavior.

This project is suitable for beginners and interview practice.

✨ Features

Separate method for each arithmetic operation

Method overloading using different parameter types

Reusable utility method for displaying results

Proper use of return values

Pass-by-value demonstration

Exception handling for divide-by-zero

Clean and modular code structure

🛠 Technologies Used

Java (Core Java)

JDK 8 or above

Command Line / VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA

📂 Project Structure
Calculator.java

▶ How to Run the Program

Open terminal or command prompt

Compile the program:

javac Main.java


Run the program:

java Calculator

🧠 Concepts Covered
1. Method Overloading

Same method name (add) is used with different parameter types (int and double).

2. Modular Programming

Each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is written in a separate method.

3. Exception Handling

Division by zero is handled using try-catch and ArithmeticException.

4. Pass-by-Value

Java passes a copy of the variable, so original value does not change.

5. Utility Method

A common method is used to display results to reduce code repetition.

📊 Sample Output
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Double Addition: 6.0
Division: 5
Before method call: 10
Inside method value: 15
After method call: 10

🎤 Interview Questions Covered

What is method overloading?

How does Java pass parameters?

Difference between return and void

What is stack memory?

Why is modular code important?

📌 Conclusion

This project helps in understanding basic Java programming concepts using a real example.
The modular approach makes the code easy to read, test, and maintain, which is important for interviews and real-world applications.
